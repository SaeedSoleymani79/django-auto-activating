# Django-auto-activating
using my Python skills to automate activating env and running the Django server.

This is a very short piece of code but very handy.
If like me you're working on projects that need to be run on a local server, this piece of code can save you time.

On your computer, run cmd.py on your editor and it will automatically activate your Python env and run the 'python manage.py runserver' command in the command prompt.
